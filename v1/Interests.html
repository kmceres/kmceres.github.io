									<h4>Career goals</h4>
									<p>I am pursuing combined DVM-PhD training because I want to develop multidisciplinary skills in epidemiology, 
									   computational biology, statistics and veterinary medicine so that I can drive impactful research in ecological health.
									   I want to be a leader in quantitative epidemiology research aimed at understanding and preventing 
									   infectious disease transmission using data driven, computational approaches, and by taking advantage of natural 
									   host-pathogen paired animal models of disease transmission and evolution where appropriate. I plan to use each 
									   part of my diverse training in epidemiology, statistics, genomics and veterinary medicine, and bridge these 
									   experiences together to become a leader in comparative computational infectious disease epidemiology. </p>

										<h4>Research motivation</h4>
										<p>One health solutions focused on ecological health</p>
									</header>
									<p> Humans are not separate from nature, we are of nature. Our health is directly linked to the health of the natural 
									    spaces we inhabit. To ensure we have clean water, adequate food, and to control emerging and endemic
									    infectious diseases, smart natural resource management is critical. My main motivation is to protect and improve 
									    animal health and human health by focusing on ecological health systems. Instead of focusing on the health of the 
									    individual, I prefer to study the health of the ecological system, which involves animals, humans, and the natural 
									    resources they share.  
									</p>

										<h4>Research Interrests </h4>

										<h5>Pathogen evolution and epidemiology</h4>
									</header>
									<p> I'm interested in combining pathogen genome sequencing, population genetics theory and epidemiology to look backward 
								            in time in order to understand how pathogens are transmitted within and between populations and how they evolve. 
									    I'm particularly interested in leveraging my comparative veterinary medicine background to study the evolution 
									    of pathogens in diverse host species. </p>
									</br>
									<header>
										<h5> Computational biology and methods development </h4>
									</header>
									<p> Most statistical genetics tools were developed for diploid eukaryotes and may be inappropriate for understanding 
									    the molecular evolution of prokaryotes. I'm interested in developing new computational tools that specialize in prokaryotic 
										evolution to aid in epidemiologic investigations and to help us make clinical decisions that shape the evolutionary
										tragectories towards less antimicrobial resistance.</p>
									
									</br>
									<header>
										<h5>Sustainable fishing and agriculture </h4>
									</header>
									<p>I want to be a leader in sustainable agriculture through infectious disease control in a future where climate 
									   change will alter global infectious disease dynamics, and human population growth will demand an increase in 
									   animal food products. Producing enough healthy food to feed the world is and will continue to be a demanding 
									   task that will require innovation to accomplish. I plan to use my specialized training to find novel solutions 
									   to infectious disease control at the intersection of domestic animals, humans, and wildlife to ensure that we 
									    produce enough, safe, and sustainable animal-based products to feed the world</p>
